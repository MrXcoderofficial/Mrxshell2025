PHP Web Shells

This repository features a collection of encrypted PHP web shells that are designed to bypass security measures on secure servers. The encryption ensures that:

Server Detection is Prevented: Thanks to my custom PHP encoder, these shells remain undetectable.

Security Measures are Bypassed: The encryption system effectively bypasses server security, providing seamless operation.
